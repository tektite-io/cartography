#### Relationships

- GitHubUsers or GitHubOrganizations own GitHubRepositories.

    ```
    (GitHubUser)-[OWNER]->(GitHubRepository)
    (GitHubOrganization)-[OWNER]->(GitHubRepository)
    ```

- GitHubRepositories in an organization can have [outside collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#collaboratoraffiliation) who may be granted different levels of access, including ADMIN,
WRITE, MAINTAIN, TRIAGE, and READ ([Reference](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#repositorypermission)).

    ```
    (GitHubUser)-[:OUTSIDE_COLLAB_{ACTION}]->(GitHubRepository)
    ```

- GitHubRepositories in an organization also mark all [direct collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#collaboratoraffiliation), folks who are not necessarily 'outside' but who are granted access directly to the repository (as opposed to via membership in a team).  They may be granted different levels of access, including ADMIN,
WRITE, MAINTAIN, TRIAGE, and READ ([Reference](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#repositorypermission)).

    ```
    (GitHubUser)-[:DIRECT_COLLAB_{ACTION}]->(GitHubRepository)
    ```

- GitHubRepositories use ProgrammingLanguages
    ```
   (GitHubRepository)-[:LANGUAGE]->(ProgrammingLanguage)
    ```
- GitHubRepositories have GitHubBranches
    ```
   (GitHubRepository)-[:BRANCH]->(GitHubBranch)
    ```
- GitHubRepositories have GitHubBranchProtectionRules.
    ```
   (GitHubRepository)-[:HAS_RULE]->(GitHubBranchProtectionRule)
    ```
- GitHubTeams can have various levels of [access](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#repositorypermission) to GitHubRepositories.

  ```
  (GitHubTeam)-[ADMIN|READ|WRITE|TRIAGE|MAINTAIN]->(GitHubRepository)
  ```

- GitHubUsers who have committed to GitHubRepositories in the last 30 days are tracked with commit activity data.

  ```
  (GitHubUser)-[:COMMITTED_TO]->(GitHubRepository)
  ```

  This relationship includes the following properties:
  - **commit_count**: Number of commits made by the user to the repository in the last 30 days
  - **last_commit_date**: ISO 8601 timestamp of the user's most recent commit to the repository
  - **first_commit_date**: ISO 8601 timestamp of the user's oldest commit to the repository within the 30-day period

### GitHubOrganization

Representation of a single GitHubOrganization [organization object](https://developer.github.com/v4/object/organization/). This node contains minimal data for the GitHub Organization.

    ```

- GitHubTeams are resources under GitHubOrganizations

    ```
    (GitHubOrganization)-[RESOURCE]->(GitHubTeam)
    ```

- GitHubUsers relate to GitHubOrganizations in a few ways:
  - Most typically, they are members of an organization.
  - They may also be org admins (aka org owners), with broad permissions over repo and team settings.  In these cases, they will be graphed with two relationships between GitHubUser and GitHubOrganization, both `MEMBER_OF` and `ADMIN_OF`.
  - In some cases there may be a user who is "unaffiliated" with an org, for example if the user is an enterprise owner, but not member of, the org.  [Enterprise owners](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/roles-in-an-enterprise#enterprise-owners) have complete control over the enterprise (i.e. they can manage all enterprise settings, members, and policies) yet may not show up on member lists of the GitHub org.

    ```
    # a typical member
    (GitHubUser)-[MEMBER_OF]->(GitHubOrganization)

    # an admin member has two relationships to the org
    (GitHubUser)-[MEMBER_OF]->(GitHubOrganization)

    (GitHubTeam)-[MEMBER_OF_TEAM]->(GitHubTeam)
    ```

- GitHubUsers may be ['immediate'](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#teammembershiptype) members of a team (as opposed to being members via membership in a child team), with their membership [role](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/enums#teammemberrole) being MEMBER or MAINTAINER.
